	Doghouse Sportfishing is one of the top boats for outer banks fishing charters on the Outer Banks. The Doghouse is a 61 foot, custom Carolina boat, certified to carry 24 passengers and with a 17 foot cockpit and a 17 foot salon, we have ample room for everyone.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In high demand times, we run a 6:00 a.m. until 10:30 a.m. half day, and also a 11:00 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. inshore trip. Call ahead to check on availability of these two time slots. The evening is always offered, due to it’s popularity.
		<br><br>The full day, offshore trip is offered year ‘round. These trips are the ones we fish for marlin, tuna, dolphin (mahi-mahi), and wahoo. Check out our pictures to get an idea what you can expect to catch during the time of year you will be fishing with us. This trip is ten to twelve hours long. From June 1st to August 31st, the time for these trips is 4:00 a.m. until approximately 3:30 p.m. The rest of the year we run from 5:00 a.m. until around 4:00 p.m. These times do fluctuate sometimes for different reason, so shoot us an e-mail, or give us a call to double check your departure time.
